# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

## Description

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most *one* transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution - description

An intuitive way of solving the problem is to iterate through the list and find a valid pair (buy before sell) with the max profit. However, this introduces time complexity of O(n^2).

We start from an easy problem, that is to find the max difference in a list regardless of order. This can be done with one traversal, where we record the max and min value along the way. The stock problem is a modified version of this. Along the traversal, we record the "so far" max difference in the list and look for values that potentially provides larger difference later on. We change the max difference if we found one, else we stick to what we have.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        max_profit = 0
        buy_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < buy_price:
                buy_price = prices[i]
            elif prices[i] - buy_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = prices[i] - buy_price
        
        return max_profit
```

## Complexity

* Time complexity:  O(n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
