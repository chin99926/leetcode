# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted

## Description

Given an array of integers that is already ***sorted in ascending order***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

* Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## Solution - description

This problem takes in a sorted array / list as input. Such a sorted  array helps us find the pair by starting from two ends of the array and moving two indices closer to the middle. This enables us to traverse all possible choices while waiving the need for a hash table as reference.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        
        # Make sure l and r do not refer to the same number in numbers
        while l < r:
            lr_sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if lr_sum == target:
                return [l+1, r+1]
            elif lr_sum > target:
                r -= 1
            elif lr_sum < target:
                l += 1
```

## Complexity

* Time complexity:  O(n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
