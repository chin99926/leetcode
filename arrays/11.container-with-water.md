# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

## Description

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

## Solution - description

Since we want to build a maximum container, the first intuition is to maximize the width (distance between vertical lines). Following this intuition, we start from two ends of the array and find potentially larger containers as we go to vertical lines in the middle. As the width gets smaller, only hope for finding a larger container is to find higher vertical lines. Hence, we move the shorter edge toward middle to find a higher substitute, yielding a larger container.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        idx_left = 0
        idx_right = len(height) - 1
        while idx_left < idx_right:
            area = (idx_right - idx_left) * min(height[idx_left], height[idx_right])
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
            if height[idx_left] < height[idx_right]:
                idx_left += 1
            else:
                idx_right -= 1

        return max_area
```

## Complexity

* Time complexity:  O(n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
