# 1. Two Sum

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

## Description

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution - description

The first and the easiest way of finding the pair is to form two for loops that traverse the `nums` list and identify the indices of two numbers. This gives time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1). Another approach is to create a hash table that records the indices of each number in the list. This allows direct reference to an existing number and thus gives overall time complexity of O(n).

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        index_map = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            # If complement for nums[i] already exists in earlier part of list
            if complement in index_map:
                return [index_map[complement], i]
            
            # Record existence in the hash table
            index_map[nums[i]] = i
```

## Complexity

* Time complexity:  O(n)
* Space complexity: O(n)
