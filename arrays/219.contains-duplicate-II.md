# 217. Contains Duplicate II

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/

## Description

Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```

## Solution - description

This problem is similar to problem 217, with an additional check on distance between duplicate elements. This can be done by modifying the hash map to store the last-occuring index that is used to check the distance. A duplicate is recognized only when the absolute difference between the stored index and the current index is at most `k`.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        nums_index = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in nums_index and i - nums_index[nums[i]] <= k:
                return True
            nums_index[nums[i]] = i
        
        return False
```
