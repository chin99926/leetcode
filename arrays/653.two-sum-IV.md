# 653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iv-input-is-a-bst/

## Description

Given a Binary Search Tree and a target number, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.

Example 1:

```
Input: 
    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Target = 9

Output: True
```

## Solution - description

To find out if there exist two elements in the tree such that their sum equals the target, we traverse the tree from the root to ensure that all elements are taken into account. As we traverse the tree, we record the values along the way in a hash table and examine if we have found the pair every time we look at a new node.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findTarget(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> bool:
        value_set = set()
        node_list = [root]
        while len(node_list) > 0:
            # Check if we found the pair
            node = node_list.pop(0)
            val = node.val
            if k - val in value_set:
                return True
            
            # Put upcoming children into the list to be checked
            value_set.add(val)
            if node.left is not None:
                node_list.append(node.left)
            if node.right is not None:
                node_list.append(node.right)
        
        return False
```
