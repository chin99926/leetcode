# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

## Solution - description

This problem is similar to problem #33, where we find a target in a rotated sorted array. Again, we break the array into two halves and check the edge of each subarray to determine if the subarray contains discontinuation, since the discontinuation is essentially what we are looking for. By recursively calling the function to narrow down the subarray, we eventually locate the discontinuation and the right side of it is the answer to this problem.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mid_idx = len(nums) // 2 - 1
        if len(nums) == 1 or nums[0] < nums[-1]:
            # If the array has one element or has no rotation
            return nums[0]
        elif nums[mid_idx] > nums[mid_idx+1]:
            # Found the discontinuation
            return nums[mid_idx+1]
        elif nums[0] > nums[mid_idx]:
            return self.findMin(nums[0:mid_idx+1])
        else:
            return self.findMin(nums[mid_idx+1:])
```

## Complexity

* Time complexity:  O(log n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
