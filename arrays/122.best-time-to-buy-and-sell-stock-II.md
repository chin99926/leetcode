# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

## Description

Say you have an array `prices` for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution - description

This is a simpler version of the original stock problem. Since we can buy and sell as many times as possible, the strategy is simple: buy at the points when stock price stops decreasing, and sell at the points when stock price stops increasing. This ensures that we don't lose any profit when the stock price falls, and can be done in a simple traversal.

In practice, the buy and sell price could be done by keeping a single variable `prev\_price`, which indicates whether to buy or sell the stock.

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        total_profit = 0
        prev_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prev_price:
                # Think of this as selling at this high point while (conceptually) buying back
                # to gain profit if the price grows higher
                total_profit += prices[i] - prev_price
            
            prev_price = prices[i]
        
        return total_profit
    
```
