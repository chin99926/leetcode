# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Solution - description

Although the array is rotated, we can still get information by observing the edges of the array. When we look at a subarray, if the element on the left edge is smaller than the one on the right, then this subarray does not contain rotation. Otherwise, the rotation (discontinuation) exists in this subarray. Based on two different cases, we can check whether the target is potentially in this subarray, and decide whether to search in it.

In practice, we do the above by breaking arrays into two halves, i.e. start ~ mid and (mid+1) ~ end. We only choose one of the two to search deeper, and repeat this step until we have our answer. This approach yields time complexity of O(log n). Note in the code that we do a direct search when subarray has length smaller than 3. This helps avoid the trouble when we deal with indexing, and since 1) this is only done once per complete search, 2) the length of direct search does not continue to grow with n (always <= 3), we say that mean time complexity is O(log n).

## Solution - code

Language: Python3

```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        return self.searchInRange(nums, target, 0, len(nums) - 1)
        
    def searchInRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int, start: int, end: int) -> int:
        if end - start < 3:
            # Directly handle cases where start or end might be mid or mid+1
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                if nums[i] == target:
                    return i
            return -1
        
        mid = start + (end - start + 1) // 2 - 1
        if nums[start] < nums[mid] and (nums[start] <= target and target <= nums[mid]):
            return self.searchInRange(nums, target, start, mid)
        elif nums[start] > nums[mid] and (nums[start] <= target or target <= nums[mid]):
            return self.searchInRange(nums, target, start, mid)
        elif nums[mid+1] < nums[end] and (nums[mid+1] <= target and target <= nums[end]):
            return self.searchInRange(nums, target, mid + 1, end)
        elif nums[mid+1] > nums[end] and (nums[mid+1] <= target or target <= nums[end]):
            return self.searchInRange(nums, target, mid + 1, end)
        else:
            return -1
```
